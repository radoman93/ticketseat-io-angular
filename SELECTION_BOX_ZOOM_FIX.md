# Selection Box Zoom Fix - Completed

## Problem
Selection box positioning was incorrect at zoom levels other than 100%.

## Root Cause
The table-container div had default transform-origin of "50% 50%" (center), which meant scaling happened from the center of the element. However, the selection canvas calculations assumed top-left origin (0, 0), causing misalignment when zoomed.

## Solution
Changed the transform-origin of the table-container to "0 0" (top-left) to match the coordinate system used by the canvas selection renderer.

### Code Change
In `grid.component.html`:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="table-container"
  [style.transform]="'translate(' + store.panOffset.x + 'px, ' + store.panOffset.y + 'px) scale(' + store.zoomLevel / 100 + ')'">

<!-- After -->
<div class="table-container"
  [style.transform]="'translate(' + store.panOffset.x + 'px, ' + store.panOffset.y + 'px) scale(' + store.zoomLevel / 100 + ')'"
  [style.transform-origin]="'0 0'">
```

## Why This Works
1. Both the DOM elements and canvas selection now scale from the same origin point (top-left)
2. The coordinate calculations in `calculateSelectionBox` method are correct: `(element.x * zoom) + panX`
3. No changes needed to the canvas rendering logic or coordinate calculations

## Testing
The fix should now work correctly at all zoom levels:
- 50% zoom
- 70% zoom (user's reported issue)
- 100% zoom
- 150% zoom
