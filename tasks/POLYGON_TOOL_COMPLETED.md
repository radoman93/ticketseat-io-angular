## User Flow
1. User selects Polygon tool from toolbar
2. First click sets the starting point (visually indicated)
3. Mouse movement shows preview line from last point to cursor
4. Each subsequent click adds a new vertex to the polygon
5. Lines connect all vertices in order
6. When hovering near the starting point, it highlights
7. Clicking the starting point closes and fills the polygon
8. Escape key cancels the current polygon drawing

## Tasks and Subtasks

### 1. Data Models and Types
- [x] Add `POLYGON` to `ElementType` enum in `src/app/models/layout.model.ts`
- [x] Create `PolygonElement` interface:
  ```typescript
  interface PolygonElement extends LayoutElement {
    type: ElementType.POLYGON;
    points: Array<{x: number, y: number}>; // Array of vertices
    fillColor: string; // default: '#0000ff'
    fillOpacity: number; // default: 0.3
    borderColor: string; // default: '#000000'
    borderThickness: number; // default: 2
    showBorder: boolean; // default: true
    name: string;
  }
  ```
- [x] Update `TableElement` union type to include `PolygonElement`

### 2. Tool System Integration
- [x] Add `Polygon = 'polygon'` to `ToolType` enum
- [x] Update `ToolStore` to handle polygon tool state (automatically handled by existing architecture)
- [x] Create polygon tool icons (active and inactive states) - Already exist in assets
- [x] Add polygon tool button to toolbar
- [ ] Add appropriate cursor style for polygon drawing mode

### 3. Polygon Component
- [x] Create `src/app/components/polygon/polygon.component.ts`
- [x] Create `src/app/components/polygon/polygon.component.html`
- [x] Create `src/app/components/polygon/polygon.component.css`
- [x] Implement SVG-based polygon rendering:
  - Render filled polygon with specified color and opacity
  - Render border/stroke if enabled
  - Show vertices as small circles during preview/editing
  - Highlight starting point during drawing
- [x] Add selection highlight support
- [x] Handle viewer vs editor mode
- [x] Implement MobX reactions for reactive updates
- [x] Add PolygonComponent to Grid component imports
- [x] Add polygon element rendering in grid template
- [x] Add polygon selection calculation methods

### 4. Drawing Logic in Grid Component
- [x] Add polygon drawing state:
  ```typescript
  isDrawingPolygon: boolean = false;
  polygonPoints: Array<{x: number, y: number}> = [];
  ```
- [x] Handle mouse events when polygon tool is active:
  - Track all clicked points in order
  - Show preview line from last point to current mouse position
  - Detect when mouse is near starting point (e.g., within 10px)
  - Highlight starting point when hoverable
  - Close polygon when starting point is clicked
- [x] Add preview rendering:
  - Show lines connecting all current points
  - Show preview line to mouse cursor
  - Show vertices as small circles
  - Highlight starting point when near
- [x] Handle escape key to cancel drawing
- [x] Minimum 3 points validation before allowing closure
- [x] Fix SVG-based line rendering with proper coordinates

### 5. Selection and Movement
- [x] Implement polygon selection hit detection:

  - Consider both fill and stroke areas
- [x] Calculate selection box for polygons:
  - Find bounding box of all vertices
  - Add padding for border thickness
- [x] Integrate with `SelectionStore`
- [x] Implement drag movement:
  - Move all vertices by same delta
  - Maintain relative positions
- [x] Support multi-selection with other elements
- [x] Add polygon support to DragStore for movement

### 10. Testing and Polish
- [ ] Test polygon drawing with various shapes:
  - Triangle (minimum vertices)
  - Rectangle/Square
  - Complex polygons (10+ vertices)
  - Star shapes
  - Self-intersecting polygons
- [ ] Test selection accuracy
- [ ] Test movement and positioning
- [ ] Test export/import
- [ ] Test undo/redo
- [ ] Performance testing with many vertices
- [ ] Edge cases:
  - Clicking same point multiple times
  - Very small polygons
  - Polygons extending beyond canvas

## Technical Considerations
- Polygons should follow the same coordinate system (origin top-left)
- Use SVG path elements for efficient rendering
- Consider using `fill-rule="evenodd"` for self-intersecting polygons
- Implement efficient point-in-polygon algorithm for hit testing
- Use MobX patterns consistently with other components
- Ensure proper cleanup in component OnDestroy
- Consider performance with complex polygons (many vertices)
- Handle z-index/layering with other elements
