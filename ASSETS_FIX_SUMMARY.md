# Assets Fix Deployment Summary

## Problem
When the GitHub Action builds the Angular library package, the `assets` folder containing toolbar icons was not being included in the `dist` folder, causing icons to not load when the library is used by consumers.

## Root Cause
The `ng-packagr` tool used for building Angular libraries does not automatically copy static assets like images and icons. Only TypeScript files, styles, and other core library files are included by default.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Process
- **File**: `package.json`
- **Change**: Added `copy:assets` script to the main build command
- **Details**: Added `&& npm run copy:assets` to the build script and created `"copy:assets": "cp -r ./src/assets ./dist/assets"`

### 2. Enhanced Package Export Configuration  
- **File**: `add-css-export.js`
- **Change**: Added assets export to the dist package.json
- **Details**: Now adds `"./assets/*": { "default": "./assets/*" }` to the exports field

### 3. Improved Package Verification
- **File**: `verify-package.js`  
- **Change**: Added assets and icons directory verification
- **Details**: Checks for existence of `assets/` and `assets/icons/` directories in dist

### 4. Updated Documentation
- **Files**: `README.md`, `USAGE_EXAMPLE.md`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added "Assets Setup" section with two configuration options
  - Added troubleshooting section for icon loading issues
  - Provided clear instructions for copying assets or configuring angular.json

## Verification

### Build Output Verification
```bash
✅ Assets directory found
✅ Icons directory found
```

### Dist Folder Structure
```
dist/
├── assets/
│   └── icons/
│       └── toolbar/
│           ├── active/
│           │   ├── round-table-tool.svg
│           │   ├── rectangular-table-tool.svg
│           │   └── ... (other icons)
│           └── inactive/
│               └── ... (corresponding inactive icons)
├── package.json (with assets export)
├── styles.css
└── ... (other library files)
```

### Package.json Exports
```json
{
  "exports": {
    "./styles.css": { "default": "./styles.css" },
    "./assets/*": { "default": "./assets/*" },
    ".": { "types": "./index.d.ts", "default": "./fesm2022/..." }
  }
}
```

## User Instructions

### Option 1: Copy Assets (Recommended)
```bash
cp -r node_modules/@radoman93/ticketseat-io-angular/assets ./src/assets/
```

### Option 2: Configure angular.json
```json
{
  "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico", 
    "src/assets",
    {
      "glob": "**/*",
      "input": "node_modules/@radoman93/ticketseat-io-angular/assets",
      "output": "assets"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Icons will now load correctly when the library is installed and used
- ✅ GitHub Actions will successfully build packages with all required assets
- ✅ Consumers have clear documentation on how to set up assets
- ✅ Build verification ensures assets are included before publishing

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Added copy:assets script
2. `add-css-export.js` - Added assets export configuration  
3. `verify-package.js` - Added assets verification
4. `README.md` - Added assets setup and troubleshooting documentation
5. `USAGE_EXAMPLE.md` - Added setup requirements section

The fix ensures that when the GitHub Action runs the build process, all necessary assets are included in the published package, and consumers have clear instructions on how to make those assets available in their applications.
